And so the adventure begins! I started this blog in order to raise awareness on the important things in life: Faith, Family, Friends and Growing Potatoes.

<!--more-->

We have all, at one point of our lives or another, been consumed in the daily routine, and lost our focus on what is important in life. This blog will record my journey, offering advice and encouragement for everyone. I certainly do not have all the answers, but together we can build a community that strives to Grow Potatoes! 

## Faith
Some of us are religious, others not. We do all however believe in something, even if that has nothing to do with religion. Lately we have all lost a bit of our faith in things that should matter in our lives. Time to get it back!

## Family
The last few years have been extremely challenging for families. A combination of political and health related factors, created an environment where family members would distance themselves from one another, because of that. Time to figure what is important, politics or family!

## Friends
You learn who your friends are during bad times, but you also learn who your enemies are during good times. Surrounding oneself with high quality people, that share the same values and will be there rain or shine is essential. Superficial _friends_ that are there only because they can get some sort of status by being with you, are not your friends. Time to re-evaluate! 

## Grow Potatoes
Although I will be posting more about sustainable life, canning, cooking and all that, it is important to focus on growing potatoes. By _growing potatoes_ I do not mean just the act of growing Earth's Apples. It is also to concentrate our focus on things that are not superficial. The easiest example would be to play with your kids vs. looking at your phone.... Time to Grow Potatoes!!

## Future steps
I intend on posting regularly here and my [Telegram](https://t.me/grow_potatoes) channel. I am hoping to also create short videos where I can record my progress towards a more sustainable living.

Thank you all for stopping by!

Stay safe and Grow Potatoes!
