Welcome to **GrowPotatoes.Garden**.

I started this blog in an effort to draw attention to the important things in life:
- Faith
- Family
- Friends
- Grow Potatoes

Although for some the first will be (or not) applicable to their lives, growing 
potatoes is key to keep oneself focused on what is important and what is not.

In this blog I will share my experience with sustainable living, prepping, canning,
cooking (maybe) and of course growing potatoes!

Enjoy!
